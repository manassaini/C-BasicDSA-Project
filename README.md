# C-BasicDSA-Project
Repository for my C++ project

Online school is... not fun. Not only do you learn less, but you miss out on chances to meet some of the brightest professors. One class that I had during online school was Data Structures! I learned in that class, but not as much as I would have liked to. After all, data structures is one of the most important concepts for a computer scientists and without them, you won't get really far. I felt I was still missing some knowledge and knew I had to do something about it. So instead of complaining and watching youtube videos about DS that got me nowhere, I decided to make a project with them in C++ that would really solidify my knowledge in data structures.

The four data structures I focused on were stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. I would have like to done more but there was a limited amount of time. I first made sure I had a thorough understanding of each data structure. I already had the concepts down, but just wanted to make sure. Now, it was time to code. But I did not start on my project immedietly, that will come later. I first went onto GeeksForGeeks and practiced easy coding problems for each data structure. I really focused on solving these problems from start to finish without any help. This is because the main goal of these problems is to work on your problem solving skills. I spent hours and hours whiteboarding, drawing, writing pseudocode, debugging until I solved all problems. Some problems were very easy, some were very hard for me (though they were all EASY level on GeeksForGeeks). It felt good when I solved those problems. I did most of the easy problems for each data structure on GeeksForGeeks and the moved to other sources such as LeetCode and TechieDelight. Important note: I wrote the code for these problems on my own IDE. And this is what sparked the idea of building a project.

Now that I finished the hard part (solving all these algorithms and getting a good grip on these data structures), I thought why not build a project that has a clean UI that allows users to select an algorithm for a data structure and see it in action. I already have the code for each algoritm in my IDE so I can just use that. Basically I was thinking: "I already did the hard part, let's just make an interactive UI that allows the user to navigate around each data strucutre and algorithm. 

Algorithms for DS
Stacks: Balanced Parantheses, Postfix, Reverse Array, Greater Right
Queues: Reverse Queue, Modify Queue, Interleave Queue
Linked Lists: Add Node to Front, Add Node to End, Find Specific Node, Delete Specific Node, Get Middle of List, Remove Duplicates
Trees: Pre/in/Post Order Traversal, Search in BST, Insert in BST, Is Same Tree, Sum Nodes of Tree

Usage:
The program gives an explanation on how to run the project. Each algorithm is explained as well. Very easy to use
