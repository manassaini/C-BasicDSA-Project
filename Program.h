        cout << "1. The program will first ask you which data structure you would like to work with." << endl;
        cout << "2. Then, you will be asked which specific algorithm you would like to see for that data structure." << endl;
        cout << "3. Since all the algorithms have their own names, the program will explain each one to you and give I/O examples." << endl;
        cout << "4. You will then be asked which input you would like to run for that algorithm." << endl;
        cout << "5. The algorithm will run with the specific input, and you will see that it indeed does work correctly." << endl;
        cout << "6. You will then be asked if you would like to see the code for that algorithm and how it works." << endl;
